# Cubee
This is the place where you can find all of the files from [this](https://youtu.be/0Hg8M8QiM0w) video by me, [plighting_engineerd](https://www.youtube.com/c/plightingengineerd/).

## Video
In my video, I recreated the [Cubee pet](https://www.makeship.com/products/cubee-plush) from the [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) Bedrock Edition featured server called [The Hive](https://playhive.com). I modeled and textured it using [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/), then brought it into the game using [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/).

## Files
Here, you can find texture packs and mods for Bedrock and Java, as well as some of the raw files. These include the custom model (in .java, .geo and .bbmodel forms) as well as the texture for the custom model and the texture pack.

## License
You **may** use my recreation of the Hive's Cubee in modpacks, social media (e.g. YouTube, Twitter, etc.) **with attribution to me**. This does not guarantee that The Hive will approve of all uses, as they created the name, model, texture, and animations, the latter three of which I recreated as accurately as possible. This being said, **it should be clear that the original version was created by Hive Games.**
